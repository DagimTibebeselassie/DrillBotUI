# Robot UI for Morse Code Research Project

## Introduction
This README document provides an overview of the Robot UI designed for the Morse Code Research project at Georgia State University. The UI is developed to control a drilling robot equipped with various sensors and cameras for data collection purposes.

## Components
The Robot UI consists of the following components:
1. Joystick for navigation control.
2. Buttons for drill movement: up, down, left, right.
3. Stop button to halt operations.
4. Buttons for sample selection/filtering.
5. Two cameras for visual monitoring.
6. Data collection modules for GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and joystick data.

## Technologies Used
The UI is developed using Plotly Dash, which utilizes HTML and CSS components for user interface design. Additionally, it integrates with various Python libraries for data processing and visualization.

## Functionality
### Navigation Control
- The joystick enables users to navigate the UI, controlling the movement of the robot.

### Drill Movement
- The UI provides buttons for controlling the vertical and horizontal movement of the drill:
  - **Drill Up**: Raises the drill.
  - **Drill Down**: Lowers the drill.
  - **Drill Left**: Moves the drill horizontally to the left.
  - **Drill Right**: Moves the drill horizontally to the right.

### Operation Control
- **Stop Button**: Allows users to halt the operation of the robot.

### Sample Selection
- Users can use buttons to filter through different samples, facilitating data collection and analysis.

### Data Collection
- The UI facilitates the collection of various data types:
  - **GPS Data**: Captures location information.
  - **Accelerometer Data**: Measures acceleration forces.
  - **Gyroscope Data**: Tracks orientation changes.
  - **Joystick Data**: Records user inputs for navigation control.

## Usage
As the project is currently unfinished, the full functionality of the UI can only be experienced in conjunction with the actual robot. Once the project is completed, users can interact with the UI to control the robot's drilling operations, monitor visual feed from the cameras, and collect data from the onboard sensors.
